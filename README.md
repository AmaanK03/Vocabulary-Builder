# Vocabulary-Builder

A vocabulary builder application using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js). This project allows users to input words in their primary language and their equivalents in  2 more different languages, featuring CRUD operations. 
##  Technologies ‚öôÔ∏è
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing vocabulary data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for server-side logic.
- **Vue.js**: Frontend framework for a reactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.
- **Vuex**: State management library for Vue.js.
- **Nodemon**: Tool for automatically restarting the server during development.

##  Features
Here's what you can do with the Vocab Builder:

### Vocabulary Management üì¶
- **Add New Words**: Input new vocabulary words with their meanings in different languages.
- **Edit Words**: Modify existing words and their translations.
- **Delete Words**: Remove words that are no longer needed.
- **View Words**: Browse the list of added vocabulary words.

### Quiz Mode üë®üèª‚Äçüè´
- **Test Knowledge**: Take quizzes to test your vocabulary knowledge in different languages.




##  The Process üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥
I began by setting up the project structure and configuring the server with Express.js. The next steps were:

1. **Database Setup**: Configured MongoDB to store vocabulary data.
2. **API Development**: Developed RESTful APIs for CRUD operations using Express.js.
3. **Frontend Development**: Built the frontend using Vue.js and Vuex for state management.
4. **UI/UX Design**: Designed a user-friendly and responsive interface.
5. **Feature Implementation**: Added functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing vocabulary words.
6. **Quiz Module**: Implemented a quiz feature to test users' vocabulary knowledge.
7. **Testing**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure smooth operation and bug fixes.

##  What I Learned üìö
This project interduced me to the MEVN stack, a modern web development stacks that are bundles of software and frameworks used to completely develop a web application. This stacks contain a web server to host and run the application, a database to store and retrieve data for the application, and a scripting language to facilitate operations. Additionally, they incorporate frameworks designed to manage the front-end and back-end components more effectively

### Backend Development
- **Express.js**: Gained experience in setting up and managing a Node.js server using Express.js for hosting web applications.
- **MongoDB**: Was also introduced to NoSQL databases, enhancing my understanding of their key differences from SQL databases.

### Frontend Development
- **Vue.js**: Learned to develop Single Page Applications (SPAs), improving my skills in building reactive interfaces & web development.

### Full Stack Development
- **Integration**: Improved my ability to integrate frontend and backend components to create a cohesive application.

##  How can it be improved? üí≠
- **Text-to-Speech**: Add a feature to play words out loud to improve accessibility.
- **Additional Languages**: Expand the vocabulary to include more languages.
- **Advanced Quiz Features**: Implement more advanced quiz functionalities and scoring.
