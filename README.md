# Vocabulary-Builder

A vocabulary builder application using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js). This project allows users to input words in their primary language and their equivalents in  2 more different languages, featuring CRUD operations. 
##  Technologies ⚙️
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing vocabulary data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for server-side logic.
- **Vue.js**: Frontend framework for a reactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.
- **Vuex**: State management library for Vue.js.
- **Nodemon**: Tool for automatically restarting the server during development.

##  Features
Here's what you can do with the Vocab Builder:

### Vocabulary Management 📦
- **Add New Words**: Input new vocabulary words with their meanings in different languages.
- **Edit Words**: Modify existing words and their translations.
- **Delete Words**: Remove words that are no longer needed.
- **View Words**: Browse the list of added vocabulary words.

### Quiz Mode 👨🏻‍🏫
- **Test Knowledge**: Take quizzes to test your vocabulary knowledge in different languages.
